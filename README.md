# HKA Timetable iCal Extender

I created this project in order to parse the generated iCal file of my lecture timetable.

It fixes the iCal file so that Google Calendar can read it correctly, and it also adds instructions for Reclaim AI to
each event.

You can also merge additional modules to your timetable and remove given modules from it.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology

I use Java 21, Gradle and Spring Boot.

For parsing and editing the iCal file I use [Biweekly](https://github.com/mangstadt/biweekly), created by Michael
Angstadt.
